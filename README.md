# mappingPlatform
Code for raspberry pi which implement logic and high level control of mapping robot project.
In this repository should be implementation of movement menagers, filtering and analyzing distance measurements, map algorithms like creating, localising on map etc.
All decision about HW should be sent by SPI protocol to microcontroller which manage HW.
In this repository should be manager which provide configuration for microcontroller on EEprom by I2C bus.
